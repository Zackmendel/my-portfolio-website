 In recent months, Uniswap Labs has made significant changes to its fee structure, impacting users of its frontend interface. Initially, in October, a 0.15% fee was introduced for those using the Uniswap frontend (Link). This fee was further increased to 0.25% in April (Link). These changes have sparked discussions and analyses regarding their impact on Uniswap's overall performance and user behavior.

This analysis aims to delve into the effects of these fee changes on Uniswap's trading volume, user base, and swap activity. Key questions include whether the fee introduction and subsequent increase led to a decrease in the usage of the Uniswap Labs frontend, and if so, what alternatives users turned to. Additionally, the analysis will explore any noticeable differences in behavior between different user groups, such as whales versus smaller traders.

The following sections present the findings of this analysis, providing insights into the impact of the fee changes and offering recommendations based on the observed trends and data.

NOTE: The networks used for this analysis are: Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base, Avalanche and Blast
